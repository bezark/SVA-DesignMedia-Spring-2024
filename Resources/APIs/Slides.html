# The Internet

- The internet is an interconnected network of computers. Some computers are bigger than others, some computers are smaller than others but fundamentally everything is just a computer.

- Most devices on the internet are either **Clients** or **Servers**.
  - A client is a computer that arrives at a website asking for stuff
  - A server is a computer that sits around and waits for clients to ask for things. It then does the things the client asks for

## HTTP Requests
- HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol
- It is the backbone of the internet.

---


- There are several different types of HTTP request. The most commonly used are:

  - GET: go get something from a website or server.
  - POST: put something onto a website or server.
  - PUT: put something onto a website or server .Similar to POST but PUT is restricted to create or update operations.
  - DELETE: Delete something from a website or server.

---
### Anatomy of HTTP requests
- Requests typically have:
  - Headers - metadata about the request
  - Body: the actual information being sent to the server. Typically only used for POST or PUT requests



---
## URLs
- URL stands for Universal Resource Locator.

- URLs are often used to make API calls

- The way URLs work is they specify the address of the website, followed by a route on that website. Then they frequently include parameters passed to the server. For example:

`https://www.example.com/page?paremeter=value&another_parameter=another_value`

  - `example.com` is the website
  - `/page` is the route
  - `?` signifies the beginning of parameters
  - `paremeter=value` is an example of a key-value pair.
  - `&` signifies that another key-value will follow

## APIs

  API stands for Application Programming Interface.

  > An application programming interface (API) is a way for two or more computer programs or components to communicate with each other. It is a type of software interface, offering a service to other pieces of software. A document or standard that describes how to build or use such a connection or interface is called an API specification. A computer system that meets this standard is said to implement or expose an API. The term API may refer either to the specification or to the implementation. Whereas a system's user interface dictates how its end-users interact with the system in question, its API dictates how to write code that takes advantage of that system's capabilities.
---
  ### API Keys
  - Often times when working with APIs you need to get an API key in advance. Each service is different.
