# **Course Overview**

This course aims to provide an in-depth understanding of Extended Reality (XR) and spatial computing for immersive media. From exploring historical milestones to understanding contemporary applications, students will gain hands-on experience and learn to translate their artistic voice into the spatial context of immersive media. The course is suitable for beginners with minimal experience in XR/AR/VR coding, and for those looking to expand their knowledge.

# **Prerequisites**

- **Audience:** Senior advertising and design majors.
- **Experience Requirements:** No prior coding knowledge is required.

# **Learning Outcomes**

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Understand the evolution and fundamentals of XR and spatial computing.
- Gain hands-on experience in Godot 4, applying these design patterns to real-world scenarios.
- Apply human-centered design principles in the creation of XR applications.
- Develop applications and prototypes across mixed-reality spectrum.
- Translate artistic voice and style into immersive media applications.

# **Course Structure**

This course is broken up into four major parts, with each part lasting roughly 4 weeks. The sections are:

- Foundations
