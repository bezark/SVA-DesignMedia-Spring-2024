## First Person View

After your initial exploration of Extended Reality (XR), it's time to deepen your understanding through firsthand experiences. For this assignment, you are required to engage with two different XR experiences. You can choose to use the HTC Vive available on campus, try an AR application on your phone, or participate in a VR experience available in NYC. The goal is to immerse yourself in these environments and then reflect critically on your experiences.

As you engage with these XR experiences, consider the following questions and prompts to guide your reflection:

- **Design and Interaction:** How did the design of each experience facilitate user interaction? Note aspects like user interface, controls, and overall usability.

- **Immersion and Realism:** Compare how each experience achieves immersion. What elements (visual, auditory, tactile) made the experiences feel 'real'? How did they differ in their approach to realism?

- **Narrative and Engagement:** Reflect on the narrative or story presented in each experience. How did the narrative structure engage you? Did the XR environment enhance the storytelling?

- **Technological Integration:** Consider the technology used in each experience. How did the hardware and software come together? Were there any noticeable limitations or exceptionally well-executed features?

- **Emotional and Psychological Impact:** Describe your emotional response to each experience. Did they evoke a sense of wonder, excitement, discomfort, or something else?

- **Comparison of AR and VR:** If you chose one AR and one VR experience, discuss the key differences and similarities in these technologies. How does each medium affect the user's experience?

- **XR Design Patterns:** Identify and discuss any XR design patterns you noticed. How did these patterns enhance or detract from your experience?

- **Application and Potential:** Reflect on how the experiences could be applied in real-world scenarios. What potential do they hold for education, entertainment, training, or other fields?

- **Personal Takeaways:** What did these experiences teach you about the potential and challenges of XR? How have they influenced your understanding of XR design?

Write a reflective piece that addresses these aspects, comparing and contrasting your experiences in the two different XR environments.
