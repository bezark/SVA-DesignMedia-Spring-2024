### XR Pattern Language

[Christopher Alexander](../Resources/Christopher_Alexander/README.md)

**Objective:** You will identify, articulate, and create an XR design pattern within Godot 4, contributing to a class-wide virtual exhibition of XR design patterns in the form of an XR [Pattern Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_language). This project will deepen understanding of design principles in XR environments and demonstrate how these principles can be applied to create engaging, immersive experiences.

**Assignment Tasks:**

1. **Identify a Design Pattern:** Choose an XR design challenge and develop a design pattern that offers a solution. This could be related to user interaction, navigation, storytelling, or any other aspect of XR design you find compelling.

2. **Document the Pattern:** Write about your design pattern following the specified structure: Pattern Name, the Context, 1-3 Patterns Nested Inside, the Problem, the Solution and 1-3 Outside Patterns Containing this Pattern.

3. **Prototype in Godot 4:** Using Godot 4 and its XR toolkit, create a prototype or creative exploration that demonstrates your design pattern in action. Your scene should be an immersive experience that allows users to understand and engage with the pattern.

4. **Contribute to the XR Exhibition:** Your scene will be part of a class-wide virtual exhibition. Each studentâ€™s work will be a standalone scene within a larger Godot 4 project, allowing users to explore different design patterns through a VR headset. Students may connect their patterns to other patterns and share patterns scenes.

### Grading Rubric (Total: 20 Points)

This project is a class wide project. In order to turn it in, you must successfully merge your contribution with the [XR Pattern Language Repository](https://github.com/bezark/XR-Pattern-Language).

1. **Identification and Documentation of the Design Pattern (7 points)**
   - Clarity and relevance of the chosen pattern (2 points)
   - Comprehensive and insightful documentation following the outlined structure (5 points):
     - Pattern Name: Give the pattern a concise and memorable name.
     - The Context: Under What circumstances does this pattern appear?  (250 Words)
     - 2-5 Patterns Nested Inside this Pattern: links to other patterns made by students or talked about in class.
     - The Problem: What is the main problem this pattern solves? (250 Words)
     - The Solution: 2-3 sentences describing the solution.
     - 2-5 Outside Patterns Containing this Pattern: links to other patterns made by students or talked about in class.

2. **Prototype Implementation (7 points)**
   - The Implementation wants to have 2 different expressions:
     - *Technical Expression* (3 points): A Godot scene that shows in very simple environment the bar bones implementation of the pattern. This scene also wants to clearly display the text of your Documentation.
       - 1 point for visible documentation
       - 2 points for clear use of the pattern
     - *Poetic Expression* (4 Points): Use the pattern and any other patterns made in class to create some art! Whatever you want!
       - 1 point for elegant usage of the pattern
       - 1 point for stability
       - 1 point for creativity
       - 1 point for effort

4. **Integration into the Pattern Language (6 points)**
   - The Pattern needs to integrate seamlessly with the rest of the class Pattern Language, both conceptually and technically.
     - 2 points for correctly merging your project to the [XR Pattern Language Repository](https://github.com/bezark/XR-Pattern-Language)
     - 2 points for linking to Outside Patterns containing this pattern
     - 2 points for using and linking Patterns nested Inside this pattern

### Additional Notes for Students:
- **Collaboration:** While each student will work on an individual pattern and scene, consider how your pattern relates to others in the class. The final exhibition aims to showcase a cohesive exploration of XR design principles. Your pattern may use patterns designed by other students as part of your Poetic Expression.
- **Technical Requirements:** Ensure your prototype is optimized for VR viewing. Test functionality and user interaction to prevent issues like motion sickness or user confusion.
- **Reflection:** Include a brief reflection on what you learned through this project, both in terms of XR design and working with Godot 4. This can be part of your documentation.

This assignment encourages you to think deeply about the design challenges and opportunities within XR environments and to explore how Godot 4 can be used as a tool for creative problem-solving. Your contributions will not only enhance your understanding but also serve as a valuable resource for others interested in XR design.
