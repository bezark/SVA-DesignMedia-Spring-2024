### XR Pattern Language

[Christopher Alexander](../Resources/Christopher_Alexander/README.md)

**Objective:** You will identify, articulate, and create an XR design pattern within Godot 4, contributing to a class-wide virtual exhibition of XR design patterns in the form of an XR [Pattern Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_language). This project will deepen understanding of design principles in XR environments and demonstrate how these principles can be applied to create engaging, immersive experiences.

**Assignment Tasks:**

1. **Identify a Design Pattern:** Choose an XR design challenge and develop a design pattern that offers a solution. This could be related to user interaction, navigation, storytelling, or any other aspect of XR design you find compelling.

2. **Document the Pattern:** Write about your design pattern following the specified structure: Pattern Name, Intent, Motivation, Applicability, Structure, Implementation, Examples, Benefits and Drawbacks, Related Patterns, and References.

3. **Prototype in Godot 4:** Using Godot 4 and its XR toolkit, create a prototype or creative exploration that demonstrates your design pattern in action. Your scene should be an immersive experience that allows users to understand and engage with the pattern.

4. **Contribute to the XR Exhibition:** Your scene will be part of a class-wide virtual exhibition. Each studentâ€™s work will be a standalone scene within a larger Godot 4 project, allowing users to explore different design patterns through a VR headset. Students may connect their patterns to other patterns and share patterns scenes.

### Grading Rubric (Total: 20 Points)

1. **Identification and Documentation of the Design Pattern (6 points)**
   - Clarity and relevance of the chosen pattern (2 points)
   - Comprehensive and insightful documentation following the outlined structure (4 points)

2. **Innovation and Relevance (4 points)**
   - Originality of the design pattern and its relevance to addressing an XR design challenge (4 points)

3. **Prototype Implementation (6 points)**
   - Functionality: The prototype effectively demonstrates the design pattern within Godot 4 (2 points)
   - Immersion: The scene is engaging and utilizes XR capabilities effectively (2 points)
   - Integration: The prototype integrates well with the overall class project, maintaining consistency and navigability (2 points)

4. **Presentation and Explanation (4 points)**
   - Clarity and persuasiveness of the presentation within the virtual exhibition (2 points)
   - Ability to articulate the significance of the design pattern and its application in the prototype (2 points)

### Additional Notes for Students:
- **Collaboration:** While each student will work on an individual pattern and scene, consider how your pattern relates to others in the class. The final exhibition aims to showcase a cohesive exploration of XR design principles. Your pattern may use other patterns
- **Technical Requirements:** Ensure your prototype is optimized for VR viewing. Test functionality and user interaction to prevent issues like motion sickness or user confusion.
- **Reflection:** Include a brief reflection on what you learned through this project, both in terms of XR design and working with Godot 4. This can be part of your documentation.

This assignment encourages you to think deeply about the design challenges and opportunities within XR environments and to explore how Godot 4 can be used as a tool for creative problem-solving. Your contributions will not only enhance your understanding but also serve as a valuable resource for others interested in XR design.
