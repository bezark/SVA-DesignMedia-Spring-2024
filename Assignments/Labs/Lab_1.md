## Lab 1
After watching [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P6dDG1QA7k) please complete the following exercise:

    Create a 3D godot project that has:
  - A main scene
  - A camera
  - A WorldEnvironment and a Directional Light
  - Several instances of another scene (like a forest with several trees or rocks)
  - Create a github repository with the godot project inside and a README.md file where you describe the project and write out any questions or things you learned along the way
    Upload that project to github and submit the link to the repository page here on canvas

## Grading
