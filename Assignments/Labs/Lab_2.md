## Lab 2: Conditionals and Signals

Please complete the following exercise:

Create a 3D godot project that has:
  - The 3D Fundamentals:
    - A main scene
    - A camera
    - A Directional Light
  - A github repository (can be the same repository from last week)
  - A node with a script that:
    - Uses conditional ligic (`if`, `else`, or `elif`)
    - Responds ro user input with `Input`
  - Another node that emits a signal to a different node.

    Upload that project to github and submit the link to the repository page here on canvas

## Grading
- 1 Point for submitting anything on Github
- 1 Point for having a Main scene with a camera and durectional light
- 1 point for a node with conditional logic that responds to user Input
- 1 point for having one node send a signal to another node
