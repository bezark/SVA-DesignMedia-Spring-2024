# XR Capstone Project

## Overview
For your capstone project, you are invited to explore the boundaries of your creativity and technical skills within the realm of Extended Reality (XR). This project is your opportunity to synthesize your learning, showcase your innovation, and contribute a unique piece to the future of XR. You can choose to refine and expand upon an existing pattern or lab project, or create an entirely new speculative future world, environment, or metaverse concept.

## Objectives
- Demonstrate a deep understanding of XR design principles and technologies.
- Apply creative thinking to envision and prototype a compelling XR experience.
- Develop a polished and functional XR project using Godot 4, showcasing your technical skills.
- Document the design process, decisions, and insights in written form.

## Project Options
1. **Revise and Expand:** Take an existing pattern or lab project and significantly enhance its scope, functionality, and user experience.

2. **Speculative Design:** Create a new, speculative future world or environment. This could be a piece of an imagined metaverse, an interactive narrative, or an innovative XR application.

## Deliverables
- **Godot Project:** A polished and functional XR project developed in Godot 4. It should be an immersive, engaging experience that aligns with the chosen project option.
- **Written Documentation:** Detailed documentation covering your project's concept, design process, user interaction flow, technical challenges and solutions, and reflections on the work done.
- **Deployment (Bonus):** Additional points will be awarded for projects successfully deployed to and tested on an XR headset.

## Presentation and Critique
- Projects will be presented and critiqued in class on 4/30. Be prepared to demonstrate your project, discuss your design and development process, and receive feedback.

## Grading Rubric (Total: 30 Points)


### Option 1: Revising and Expanding an Existing Project (Total: 30 Points)
