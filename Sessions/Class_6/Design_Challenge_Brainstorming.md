1. **Introduction (5 minutes)**
   - Briefly explain the session's objectives: to share project ideas, inspire collaborative thinking, and encourage peer support.
   - Highlight the focus on positive feedback and constructive suggestions.

2. **Rapid-Fire Presentations (15 minutes)**
   - Each student has 1 minute to share the essence of their XR design pattern project idea. State:
        - The Problem
        - Any ideas on patterns or solutions
   - Encourage brevity and clarity to ensure everyone gets a chance to present within the allotted time.

3. **Interest Signaling (5 minutes)**
   - After all presentations, conduct a quick round of interest signaling. Each student can briefly mention (in a word or phrase) which projects they found intriguing or would like to discuss further.
   - This can be done verbally or through a simple show of hands to avoid any negative connotations or pressures.

4. **Interest-Based Clustering (15 minutes)**
   - Based on the interest signals, form small groups around the most mentioned or intriguing projects. Aim for diverse groups to ensure varied perspectives.
   - Each group discusses the project(s) of focus, providing first impressions, asking clarifying questions, and offering constructive feedback.

5. **Wrap-Up and Next Steps (5 minutes)**
   - Conclude with a brief plenary session where each group can share a standout insight or piece of feedback from their discussion.
   - Encourage students to incorporate the feedback into their projects and remind them of the resources available (office hours, forums, etc.) for further support.

### Facilitation Tips
- **Create a supportive atmosphere:** Emphasize the value of diverse perspectives and constructive feedback. Remind students that the goal is to help each other refine and improve their projects.
- **Encourage active listening:** During presentations and group discussions, encourage students to listen actively and think about how they can contribute positively to their peers' projects.
