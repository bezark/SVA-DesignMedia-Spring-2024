For Fbx users Metallic, Roughness, Alpha may not work properly , you may be need to re plug them or adjust the value for them. Be smart use GLTF

For gltf glb users: nothing to do, should work fine :)

if you using unreal engine please use glb , 
but if you persist to use fbx then when importing check flipped -y for normal map
 

If you think my work is usefull, you can donate me a little thing in itch, that would help me to make more FREE assets
